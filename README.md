audio-visualizer-01
===========================

This project was designed using Javascript modules: Express, Meyda (for audio feature extraction), p5 (visualizations), and dat.GUI.

The brunt of the client side coding can be found in the file [app.js](https://github.com/dylandawk/audio-visualizer-01/blob/master/app/app.js).

I essentially created a visualizer that uses the chroma feature and loudness feature to create circular arcs in varying gradients. I averaged a sample of loudness values to smooth the loudness and used a weighted average to smooth the chroma values



This app was built on a template @starakaj and then React has been removed You can find the original at https://glitch.com/~starter-react.

This template relates to video 2 of 5 in the [React Starter Kit](https://glitch.com/react-starter-kit) video series.
